Outstanding bugs
- "Sux mode," where a server<->server connection can take a long time to
  establish if one or both sides filters ident connections
- Source address support on /connect may not work under some conditions
- Squelching needs finished - Release was too important

Changes for 1.4.34
- Don't use FD_SETSIZE at all if USE_POLL is defined
- Fixed a server negotiation bug that could break apart the network
  when autoconnects and user connects were done at the same instant
- Fix a bug where PART messages were not sent to 'userB' when 'userA's 
  QUIT message was squelched on more than 1 channel
- Fixed split riding ability left over from hybrid (where a channel
  with a newer TS could 'take over' if it had ops and the older TS channel
  did not)
- Fixed 'topic riding' ability that allowed topics from newer TS'd channels
  to propogate.
- Fixed channel ban desync on netjoin
- all channel modes are now sent with a TS
- Target limiting anti-spam measure installed
- Reject acebot-style drones by default
- Minor fixes to prevent annoying auth error messages
- Minor configuration/installation fixes

-- WARNING --
1.4.34 may cause desynch in net joins if used on a network with newer servers!
This is because the algorithm for determining which channel modes to keep
when servers rejoin has changed. You should upgrade your entire network 
to 1.4.34.
