# Small AdminServ FAQ
#

Q: What is AdminServ and the /as command ?
A: AdminServ is a small tool that lets you edit the ircd's config file
   remotely, without having to log in the box the ircd runs on.

Q: What commands are available ?
A: /as {CONF, MOTD, OPERMOTD, KLINE, REHASH, SYS}

Q: How do I edit my {ircd.conf, ircd.motd, opers.txt, kline.conf} via AdminServ ?
A: The syntax is: /as WHAT COMMAND

   WHAT can only be one of the following:

   * CONF     --  edits ircd.conf
   * MOTD     --  edits ircd.motd
   * OPERMOTD --  edits opers.txt
   * KLINE    --  edits kline.conf

   The available COMMANDs are:

   * LIST                -- lists the file contents
   * ADD :text           -- adds a line with <text> at the end of the file
   * INSERT line :text   -- adds a line with <text> at line number <line>
   * REPLACE line :text  -- replaces line number <line>'s text with <text>
   * SAVE                -- saves changes (writes to file)
   * DISCARD             -- discards changes
   * CREATE              -- creates the file
   * ERASE               -- deletes the file (be careful!)

   /as keeps the modified file into an internal buffer, so if you make changes
   you must save them with SAVE or discard them with DISCARD. If you don't,
   nothing happens.

   If you modified a file, you need to rehash your ircd to apply changes.
   You can do that with either /rehash or /as rehash

   Please note that you cannot use /as to edit anything in your box other than
   the four files mentioned above.

Q: I'm opered but /as CONF LIST return 'Permission denied', why is that?
A: You must be +A (Server Administrator) to use /as.

Q: I have an 'A' in my O:line and I opered but it still doesn't work!
A: Please note that certain flags are not set when you /oper even if
   they are present; you must set them manually. +A is one of those, so
   use /mode YourNick +A before attempting to use /as.

Q: I have questions not answered here, what can I do ?
A: Mail me at vjt@users.sf.net and I will answer them as best as I can.
